                    This article measured mRNA levels in individual Escherichia coli cells and demonstrated that transcription occurs in quantal bursts. They also confirmed that the burst sizes are geometrically distributed and the time intervals between bursts are exponentially distributed, which are expected from a two state telegraph model.

                    This article studied the origin of transcriptional bursting in bacteria using in vitro, single-molecule assay. They showed that active transcription leads to positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment which in turns stops transcription initiation, while gyrase binding to the DNA segment can release positive supercoiling and resumed transcription.

                    This article studied the effects of cellular volume and DNA copy number on transcription in human cell lines. They showed that transcriptional burst size changes with cell volume and burst frequency changes with cell cycle.

                    This article showed that in fission yeast, RNA polymerase II initiation rates linearly scale with cell volume, and constitutive and periodic mRNAs follow a Poisson distribution without transcriptional off states.
