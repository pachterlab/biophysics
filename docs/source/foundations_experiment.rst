Experimental Discovery and Investigation of Transcription Dynamics
=========

Here we list a few foundational experimental works in studying transcriptional mechanisms and stochasticity.

.. dropdown::  `Stochastic gene expression in a single cell. <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1070919>`_ Elowitz et al., 2002.

                    In this article, Elowitz et. al. measured and decomposed intrinsic and extrinsic noise in gene expression. They constructed *E coli* expressing two fluorescent proteins (cfp and yfp) controlled by identical promoters. The the relative difference in fluorescence intensity of the two reporter proteins in the same cell represents intrinsic noise while the correlated fluctuation of two protein represents extrinsic noise.

                    This article measured mRNA levels in individual Escherichia coli cells and demonstrated that transcription occurs in quantal bursts. They also confirmed that the burst sizes are geometrically distributed and the time intervals between bursts are exponentially distributed, which are expected from a two state telegraph model.

                    This article used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to analyze 8,000 individual human genomic loci. They showed that bursty transcription is the major mode for the human genome, and both burst frequency and burst size can be regulated, dependent on the expression level.

                    This article studied the origin of transcriptional bursting in bacteria using in vitro, single-molecule assay. They showed that active transcription leads to positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment which in turns stops transcription initiation, while gyrase binding to the DNA segment can release positive supercoiling and resumed transcription.
