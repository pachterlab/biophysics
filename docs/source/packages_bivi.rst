*biVI:* Biophysical modeling with variational autoencoders
================================================================= 

**Abstract:** We motivate and present *biVI*, which combines the variational autoencoder framework of *scVI* with biophysically motivated, bivariate models for nascent and mature RNA distributions. While previous approaches to integrate bimodal data via the variational autoencoder framework ignore the causal relationship between measurements, *biVI* models the biophysical processes that give rise to observations. 

We demonstrate through simulated benchmarking that biVI captures cell type structure in a low-dimensional space and accurately recapitulates parameter values and copy number distributions. On biological data, *biVI* provides a scalable route for identifying the biophysical mechanisms underlying gene expression. This analytical approach outlines a generalizable strateg for treating multimodal datasets generated by high-throughput, single-cell genomic assays.
