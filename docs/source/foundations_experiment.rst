                    This article measured mRNA levels in individual Escherichia coli cells and demonstrated that transcription occurs in quantal bursts. They also confirmed that the burst sizes are geometrically distributed and the time intervals between bursts are exponentially distributed, which are expected from a two state telegraph model.

                    This article studied the effects of cellular volume and DNA copy number on transcription. They showed that transcriptional burst size changes with cell volume and burst frequency changes with cell cycle.
