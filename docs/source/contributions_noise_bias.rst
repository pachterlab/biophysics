* Length biases in single-cell RNA sequencing of pre-mRNA - G. Gorin, L. Pachter, Biophysical Reports 3 (1), 2023  

Investigates the length biases present in single-cell RNA sequencing data, particularly in the context of pre-mRNA.

* Intrinsic and extrinsic noise are distinguishable in a synthesis–export–degradation model of mRNA production* - G. Gorin, L. Pachter, bioRxiv, 2020.09. 25.312868, 2020  

Differentiates between intrinsic and extrinsic noise in mRNA production using a comprehensive model involving synthesis, export, and degradation.
