## **Our Motivation**

As biological data becomes increasingly complex and multimodal, we need tools which can interpret the relationships between these high-dimensional, noisy measurements and illuminate the intertwined components of DNA and RNA regulation. In the Pachter Lab, we harness stochastic, biophysical models to represent these high-throughput, genomics data. With our tools, we aim to explicitly model the noise in the data, to capture and reveal important biological variation as well as technical effects of the sequencing pipeline. By treating the underlying biophysical processes which generate our molecular measurements, we can uncover how the processes of the central dogma define cellular diversity, differentiation, and perturbation.
