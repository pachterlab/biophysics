* `Length biases in single-cell RNA sequencing of pre-mRNA <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpr.2022.100097>`_ - G. Gorin, L. Pachter 

Investigates the length biases present in single-cell RNA sequencing data, particularly in the context of pre-mRNA.

* `Intrinsic and extrinsic noise are distinguishable in a synthesis–export–degradation model of mRNA production <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.312868>`_ - G. Gorin, L. Pachter

Differentiates between intrinsic and extrinsic noise in mRNA production using a comprehensive model involving synthesis, export, and degradation.
