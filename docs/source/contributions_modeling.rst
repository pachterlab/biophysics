* Transient and delay chemical master equations - G. Gorin, S. Yoshida, L. Pachter, bioRxiv, 2022.10. 17.512599, 2022  

Explores the transient and delay aspects of chemical master equations, contributing to the understanding of dynamic biochemical systems.

* Interpretable and tractable models of transcriptional noise for the rational design of single-molecule quantification experiments - G. Gorin, JJ. Vastola, M. Fang, L. Pachter, Nature Communications 13, 7620, 2022  

Proposes a new modeling approach for transcriptional noise, enhancing the interpretability and utility of single-molecule quantification experiments.

* Modeling bursty transcription and splicing with the chemical master equation** - G. Gorin, L. Pachter, Biophysical Journal 121 (6), 1056-1069, 2022  

Develops a chemical master equation framework to model the bursty nature of transcription and splicing processes.

* `Length biases in single-cell RNA sequencing of pre-mRNA <https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpr.2022.100097>`_ - G. Gorin, L. Pachter 

Investigates the length biases present in single-cell RNA sequencing data, particularly in the context of pre-mRNA.

* `Intrinsic and extrinsic noise are distinguishable in a synthesis–export–degradation model of mRNA production <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.312868>`_ - G. Gorin, L. Pachter

Differentiates between intrinsic and extrinsic noise in mRNA production using a comprehensive model involving synthesis, export, and degradation.
